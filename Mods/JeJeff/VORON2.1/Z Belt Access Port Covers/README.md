# Z belt access port covers

Covers the slots in the coroplast floor where the Z belts come through, mainly to give it a nicer aesthetic and cover up any rough edges in the cuts for the slots.  As an added bonus it also holds the floor down at the corners as a side effect.

There is a slot so that this can be fed over the belts when they are already in place.
